          <h4>Ingredients</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp mild molasses</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp cider vinegar</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>4 (6- to 8- oz) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Directions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 325 deg F (160 deg C).</li>
            <li>Whisk ketchup, molasses, vinegar, Worcestershire, mustard, maple syrup, chili powder, and cayenne together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in 12-inch oven-safe skillet (such as a cast iron skillet) over medium-high heat until just smoking. Lightly brown chicken on both sides, about 2 minutes per side; transfer to plate.</li>
            <li>Pour off all oil left in skillet and add BBQ sauce, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring often, until sauce is thick and glossy, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Off heat, return chicken to skillet and coat well with sauce. Spoon extra sauce over each piece to create a thick, juicy coating. Transfer skillet to oven and bake chicken to 130 deg F, 10 to 14 minutes.</li>
            <li>Using hot pads (skillet will be hot!!) remove skillet from oven. Adjust oven rack to 5 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Broil chicken to 160 deg F, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to platter and let rest for 5 minutes. Stir sauce left in skillet to combine and transfer to bowl. Serve chicken and sauce separately.</li>

          <h4>Ingredients</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 5 ounces each), trimmed, boned, and skin slashed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mirin (or white wine)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Directions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Adjust oven rack to 8 inches below broiler; heat broiler on high.</li>
            <li>Season thighs with salt and pepper on both sides, then place on broiler pan, folding edges under to make a neat, even packet (They should be fairly thin.)</li>
            <li>Broil thighs for 8-14 minutes, rotating halfway through cooking. Thighs are done when they’re browned and a thermometer registers 175° when inserted into the thickest part of the thigh.</li>
            <li>While chicken cooks, make the sauce. In a saucepan, combine soy sauce, sugar, ginger, and garlic. In a separate small bowl, mix together mirin and cornstarch. Stir cornstarch mixture into soy sauce mixture and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Turn heat down to medium low and simmer sauce for 4 minutes, or until it becomes slightly thickened.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from oven; let rest 2-3 minutes. Slice each thigh into strips, serve over rice, and drizzle with teriyaki sauce. Sprinkle with chopped green onions.</li>
